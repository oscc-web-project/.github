## Hi, OSCC Web Project ðŸ‘‹
OSCC Web Project includes the front-end and back-end codes of all OSCC subordinate websites, as well as a collection of various tools implemented using web technology (it may be moved to a specific organization later). We hope that in the future, a complete set of SoC agile development, verification, tape-out, and testing processes can be realized based on Web technology.
